  <h2>Biology</h2>
  <p>One of the largest terrestrial snails, full-grown adults can reach almost 8 inches (20 cm) long and 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter.  Adult shells are brownish with darker brown lengthwise stripes, have seven to nine whorls including a swollen long body whorl, and covers at least half the length of the snail. Snails have female and male reproductive organs. One mating can result in multiple clutches of eggs over time. Rapid population increases are likely because each snail can produce 1,200 eggs per year.
  </p>
  <h2>Habitat</h2>
  <p>The giant snail can now be found in agricultural areas, coastland, natural forest, planted forests, riparian zones, scrub and shrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.</p>

<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>
  The giant snail can now be found in agricultural areas, coastland, natural forest, planted forests, riparian zones, scrub and shrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.
In captivity, this species can be fed on a wide range of fruit and vegetables, plain unseasoned mince, or boiled egg.
  The Giant African Snail eats leaves, flowers, fruits, stems, barks, wood, seeds, grains, nuts, seaweed and even lichens, fungi and other snails. Economically valuable crops for humans such as cauliflower, cocoa, papaya, peanut, cassava, banana and many other vegetables often become food for the giant African snail.
  They also need calcium to keep and grow hard shells, so they will consume more some types of plants to get the calcium they require. When they arenâ€™t able to get enough calcium in their diet from plants, they may feed on bones from carcasses, sand or small stones to get it.</p>
